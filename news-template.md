# Neovim Core updates

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

Nothing much this week… 🤷

# Neovim Plugin Community updates

> Neovim is full of active plugins. This section is about the community and what is going on.

People have been busy but… nothing really interesting worth discussing for this week, sadly.😢
