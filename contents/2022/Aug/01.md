</h3>

With the storm of awesome Lua plugins, there is one thing that most plugin authors don't consider is **:help** docs. Which is understandable, as help docs are tedious to write. So, why not auto-generate your plugin's help doc from [emmylua](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/EmmyLua-Annotations). Using [`lemmy-help`](https://github.com/numToStr/lemmy-help) you can autogenerate help for lua API docs, create custom section, table-of-contents and more.

This week, we have a new plugin and itâ€™s about system clipboards! `nvim-osc52` uses the ANSI OSC52 sequence. The way it
works is by writing what you want to copy to the system clipboard into Neovimâ€™s `stderr` stream. When the OSC52 sequence
is read by your terminal, it does the job to copy that content to your system clipboard.

The main advantage of this is being able to copy text whatever your `pty` is (so it works through SSH!).

A plugin by [@ojroques], which is a rewrite of his older [vim-oscyank](https://github.com/ojroques/vim-oscyank) plugin.
