With the storm of awesome Lua plugins, there is one thing that most plugin authors don't consider is **:help** docs.
Which is understandable, as help docs are tedious to write. So, why not auto-generate your plugin's help doc
from [emmylua](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/EmmyLua-Annotations).
Using [`lemmy-help`](https://github.com/numToStr/lemmy-help) you can autogenerate help for lua API docs, create custom
section, table-of-contents and more.

[@numToStr] writes about their personal experience from going from [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) (a very
famous completion framework for Vim and Neovim, which now can do lots of things like managing extensions, implementing
an LSP client, etc. etc.) to the native Neovim LSP. A chill read to look back on how we used to deal with code
intelligence between the era of the native LSP.

      <span>nvim-osc52</span>
    </span>
  </a>
</h3>

This week, we have a new plugin and itâ€™s about system clipboards! `nvim-osc52` uses the ANSI OSC52 sequence. The way it
works is by writing what you want to copy to the system clipboard into Neovimâ€™s `stderr` stream. When the OSC52 sequence
is read by your terminal, it does the job to copy that content to your system clipboard.

The main advantage of this is being able to copy text whatever your `pty` is (so it works through SSH!).

A plugin by [@ojroques], which is a rewrite of his older [vim-oscyank](https://github.com/ojroques/vim-oscyank) plugin.

A new plugin to perform conversions between epoch timestamps, by [@hlucco]. If you work a lot with different epoch
timestamps, that might be a very interesting plugin to try out! (Yes, Iâ€™m looking at you, crytocurrency developers, with
your crazy epochs).

A module of [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) (by [@echasnovski]) for extending and creating `a`/`i` textobjects (like in `di(` or `va"`). It enhances some builtin textobjects (like `a(`, `a)`, `a'`, and more), creates new ones (like `a*`, `a<Space>`, `af`, `a?`, and more), and allows user to create their own. Supports dot-repeat, `v:count`, different search methods, consecutive application, and customization via Lua patterns or functions. Has builtins for brackets, quotes, function call, argument, tag, user prompt, and any punctuation/digit/whitespace character.

- Restart a container with the <kbd>r</kbd> key.
- Delete a container by pressing <kbd>dd</kbd>.
- Tail a container's logs by pressing <kbd>t</kbd>.
- Focus the log popup by pressing <kbd>tab</kbd>.
- Toggle whether the cursor should stick to the bottom of the log popup by pressing <kbd>t</kbd> while inside the log popup.
- Focus the main popup by pressing <kbd>shift-tab</kbd>.

Lots of internal cleanups and improvements as well.
