# Disclaimer about licensing

The beginning of this third edition of TWiN requires a small disclaimer about licensing. From the very first commit in
[TWiN](https://github.com/phaazon/this-week-in-neovim.org) and the first commit in the
[contents repository](https://github.com/phaazon/this-week-in-neovim-contents), all the work has been licensed BSD-3 New
Clause. That is a license that I, [@phaazon], have been using since I was 11 (so a pretty long time). However, it was
brought to my attention that even though that license is fine for code, it does not really apply to prose content.

For this reason, all the contributions made to the contents repository are licensed CC-BY-SA-4.0. You can find the
license [here](https://github.com/phaazon/this-week-in-neovim-contents/blob/master/LICENSE).

And now, letâ€™s get a full batch of Neovim news!

With the storm of awesome Lua plugins, there is one thing that most plugin authors don't consider is **:help** docs.
Which is understandable, as help docs are tedious to write. So, why not auto-generate your plugin's help doc
from [emmylua](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/EmmyLua-Annotations).
Using [`lemmy-help`](https://github.com/numToStr/lemmy-help) you can autogenerate help for lua API docs, create custom
section, table-of-contents and more.

## [New plugins](#new-plugins) {#new-plugins}

<h3 id="new-nvim-osc52">

      <span>nvim-osc52</span>
    </span>
  </a>
</h3>

This week, we have a new plugin and itâ€™s about system clipboards! `nvim-osc52` uses the ANSI OSC52 sequence. The way it
works is by writing what you want to copy to the system clipboard into Neovimâ€™s `stderr` stream. When the OSC52 sequence
is read by your terminal, it does the job to copy that content to your system clipboard.

The main advantage of this is being able to copy text whatever your `pty` is (so it works through SSH!).

A plugin by [@ojroques], which is a rewrite of his older [vim-oscyank](https://github.com/ojroques/vim-oscyank) plugin.
