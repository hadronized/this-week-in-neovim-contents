[@kylechui] wrote a Gist on how to add dot-repeat support to your plugin. They extend on using `opfunc` (see
`:h opfunc` in your Neovim instanc) to make dot-repeat even more usable. A great short article to read!

A new (and first!) plugin by [@lcheylus]. `overlength.nvim` helps highlighting the part of a line that doesn't fit into
textwidth (or any kind of width you like).

`nvim-ts-rainbow` gained improved support for highlighting JSX elements in JSX
and TSX files in `extended_mode`.
Only the tag names and angle brackets are highlighted. Props retain their usual
highlighting, which makes them easier to read.
