# Neovim Core updates

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

- Following HEAD: breaking changes on master ([#14090](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090))
  - [#19693](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19693): changed the nightly (and release) builds and
    appimages to be built on Ubuntu 20.04 instead of Ubuntu 18.04, which is
    [being deprecated by Github](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-09-github-actions-the-ubuntu-18-04-actions-runner-image-is-being-deprecated-and-will-be-removed-by-12-1-22/).
    This means that Linux releases (including app images) from now on require GLIBC 2.29 or above. Users that cannot
    upgrade their distribution need to
    [build from source](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#building) instead.

[@gbrlsnchs] made a new window picker plugin! Being used to
[nvim-window-picker](https://github.com/s1n7ax/nvim-window-picker), I can’t say it’s _that_ similar, as the design
choice of `winpick.nvim` is to put the jump shortcut as a float in the middle of the window. Quite similar, quite not.
Eh. Nice work [@gbrlsnchs]!

Woah, a new comer! Congrats to [@axelvc] for their first plugin, which is a template string converter which goal is to

You know `sed`? [@otavioschwanck] made something similar but more user-friendly, with support for multi-cursor, etc.,
and it’s in Neovim, of course. Great job.

`nvim-ts-rainbow` gained improved support for highlighting JSX elements in JSX and TSX files in `extended_mode`. Only
the tag names and angle brackets are highlighted. Props retain their usual highlighting, which makes them easier to

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

[nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) is a well known and widely used plugin for completion. But did you know
that Neovim (Vim) already supports a wide variety of completion? Among the most useful ones, in insert mode:

- The key sequence `C-x C-n` gives you words in the current file / buffer.
- The key sequence `C-x s` brings a completion menu for _spelling_ (to enable with `:set spell`).
- A super useful one, `C-x C-f` gives you path completion, which is super useful!

More on that in your Neovim instance with `:h ins-completion`.

See you all next time for a full batch of Neovim updates on the **22nd Aug 2022**!
