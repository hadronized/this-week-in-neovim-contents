[@kylechui] wrote a Gist on how to add dot-repeat support to your plugin. They extend on using `opfunc` (see
`:h opfunc` in your Neovim instanc) to make dot-repeat even more usable. A great short article to read!

[@jackpordi] reflects on his 5 years of using Vim and Neovim, from his early days of being a complete newbie,
all the way rewriting everything in Lua and switching over to Neovim LSP. A piece containing lessons learnt over the years as well as future hopes and dreams.

`nvim-ts-rainbow` gained improved support for highlighting JSX elements in JSX
and TSX files in `extended_mode`.
Only the tag names and angle brackets are highlighted. Props retain their usual
highlighting, which makes them easier to read.

`debugpy.nvim` 0.6.0 now defines a `python` debug adapter on startup if there is no such adapter registered in
[nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap). This allows it to debug tests out of the box with
[Neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest).
