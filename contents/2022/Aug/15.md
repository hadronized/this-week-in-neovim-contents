# Neovim Core updates

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

- Following HEAD: breaking changes on master ([#14090](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090))
  - [#19693](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19693): changed the nightly (and release) builds and
    appimages to be built on Ubuntu 20.04 instead of Ubuntu 18.04, which is
    [being deprecated by Github](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-09-github-actions-the-ubuntu-18-04-actions-runner-image-is-being-deprecated-and-will-be-removed-by-12-1-22/).
    This means that Linux releases (including app images) from now on require GLIBC 2.29 or above. Users that cannot
    upgrade their distribution need to
    [build from source](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#building) instead.

# Neovim Plugin Community updates

> Neovim is full of active plugins. This section is about the community and what is going on.

People have been busy but… nothing really interesting worth discussing for this week, sadly.😢

`:h opfunc` in your Neovim instanc) to make dot-repeat even more usable. A great short article to read!

[@gbrlsnchs] made a new window picker plugin! Being used to
[nvim-window-picker](https://github.com/s1n7ax/nvim-window-picker), I can’t say it’s _that_ similar, as the design
choice of `winpick.nvim` is to put the jump shortcut as a float in the middle of the window. Quite similar, quite note.
Eh. Nice work [@gbrlsnchs]!

You know `sed`? [@otavioschwanck] made something similar but more user-friendly, with support for multi-cursor, etc.,
and it’s in Neovim, of course. Great job.

`nvim-ts-rainbow` gained improved support for highlighting JSX elements in JSX and TSX files in `extended_mode`. Only
the tag names and angle brackets are highlighted. Props retain their usual highlighting, which makes them easier to

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

[nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) is a well known and widely used plugin for completion. But did you know
that Neovim (Vim) already supports a wide variety of completion? Among the most useful ones, in insert mode:

- The key sequence `C-x C-n` gives you words in the current file / buffer.
- The key sequence `C-x s` brings a completion menu for _spelling_ (to enable with `:set spell`).
- A super useful one, `C-x C-f` gives you path completion, which is super useful!

More on that in your Neovim instance with `:h ins-completion`.

See you all next time for a full batch of Neovim updates on the **22nd Aug 2022**!
