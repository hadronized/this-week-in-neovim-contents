[@simrat39] is looking for testers before merging a new refactoring of the plugin. If you are a Rust programmer and
interested into enhancing their plugin, you should probably have a look.

## [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

> This section is about various Neovim tips. People are free to contribute any tips they have on their mind, as long as
> they can be explained in short sentences. Tips are intended for any Neovim user, should they be beginners or advanced
> users.

This week, two simple tips that are must-haves for pretty much everybody.

### Around and inside text-objects!

Neovim has the support of _text-objects_, which are used in visual or operator-pending mode. `w` for instance stands for
the text-object _word_. When you are in operator pending mode, for instance right after pressing `d` for delete, pressing
`w` (so `dw`) will delete from the cursor position to the end of the word. Two modifiers exist to create more powerful
text-objects: `a` (for _around_) and `i` (for _inner_). The former will act on the text-object on its right plus its
surroundings delimiters (for a word, it‚Äôs basically the whitespaces). The latter, `i`, will apply the operation only
_inside_ the text-object. For a word, it means just the word, ignoring the whitespace around it.

With this, you can do really powerful editing. For instance, if you have this HTML code:

```html
<div class="stuff">I like cookies</div>
```

And you want to change `I like cookies` to `I love pasta`, you can simply put your cursor anywhere in that text, and
press `cit`, which translates to:

```
c = change
i = inner
t = tag
```

`t` is a text-object native to Neovim that can recognize ‚Äútags‚Äù of the filetype you are editing (here, HTML tags). So
that command will change the text inside the tag. If you wanted to completely replace the whole tag with another one,
you could have pressed `cat`, which would have removed the surroundings (i.e. the `<div>` and `</div>`).

### Open URLs

Don‚Äôt use your mouse! Place your cursor on the URL and press `gx`!
