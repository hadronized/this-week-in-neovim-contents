# Neovim Core updates

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

- [#19862](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19862) changed the behavior of `fargs` in Lua callbacks for
  `nvim_create_user_command` with `nargs='?'` to match the behavior of `nargs='*'` if no arguments were provided
  (`fargs = {}` instead of `fargs = { "" }`).

- [#19743](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19743) changed Vim functions `winheight()`, `winwidth()`,
  `getwininfo()` to return inner window width and height. In non-multigrid UI the only change is that the returned
  height now excludes winbar, and this is compatible with Vim. In multigrid UI this means the return value of these
  functions now reflect the space available for buffer lines in a window. No change in `nvim_win_get_height` and
  `nvim_win_get_width`.

- [#19931](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19931) modified the rules for defining highlights in tree-sitter
  highlights.scm.

  Previously the following two mechanisms were available
    - use a capture name with initial uppercase. `@WarningMsg.foo` automatically mapped to highlight group `WarningMsg`
    - (undocumented but often used) extend the `vim.treesitter.highlighter.hl_map` dict to translate lowercase groups.

  **Both of these are now removed**. Instead capture names, *including* the initial `@`, are now directly usable as
  highlight groups, both using ex commands and the api:

  ```
     :hi link @foo.bar MyHighlight
     :lua vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "@string.special", {fg="Green"})
  ```

  There are no special behaviour for upper-case names (case-insensitive just like all highlight group names). The same
  fallback rule still applies: if a highlight is defined for `@foo` but not for `@foo.bar`, the former is used for
  `@foo.bar` captures.

- [#19830](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19830) made some highlight group names modifications.

  Previously if a highlight group with a name outside the regexp `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` was defined, Nvim would emit an invalid
  character warning message. This has now been promoted to an error with the code `E5248`.

  Additionally the ASCII character period (`.`) and at-sign (`@`) has been added to the allowed list of characters of a
  highlight group name to support the application of defining hierarchical highlight groups, e.g. `@keyword`.

The author of `autolist.nvim`, [@gaoDean] is asking for Markdown testers, before starting to support other filetypes.
The goal is to stabilize the current state of the plugin for Markdown, then switch to other types of lists from other
filetypes.

[@phaazon] released **Mind v2.1**, which adds a lot of new features and stabilizes already existing features. The
feature set is quite large for this minor release so feel free to have a look at the Reddit announcement. Among the new
features, Mind can now be used with **Neovim 0.7.2**, doesn’t require a window-picker plugin anymore, supports tree
indexing and allows to create, search, change icons and operate trees and nodes via fuzzy searching the index, or even
supports getting nodes’ links (either data path or URL) to insert them in your document.

[@echasnovski] made a massive update of `mini.surround`. It is now more aligned with `mini.ai` (other `mini.nvim`
module). Some of new features:

- New surrounding specification format. This is a **breaking change** for those who defined custom input surroundings.
  Previous format will work until next release and transition to new one [is pretty
  straightforward](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/085baefa6aca44526be621b15e7b688f996c2daf/doc/mini.txt#L5411-L5420).
- Tree-sitter support. Thanks to new specification format you can now use tree-sitter based surroundings. More
  information is in the [help file](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/085baefa6aca44526be621b15e7b688f996c2daf/doc/mini.txt#L5727-L5826).
- "Last"/"next" extended mappings. With the same idea as in `mini.ai`, you can now use mappings with special suffixes to
  operate on previous or next surrounding.
- Support of `v:count` for input surrounding.
- For 'tpope/vim-surround' lovers, open bracket identifiers (`(`, `[`, `{`, `<`) now include inner padding.

Here is a [full list of changes](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#minisurround).

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

Macros are one of the most powerful tools of Vim / Neovim. They allow to _record_ a series of Neovim commands and
actions, and replay them later. You start recording to a record register by pressing `q` and the register (like `a`, so
`qa`), then you perform some actions and once you are done, you press `q` again to register all those actions to the
`a` macro.

Then, you can invoke the macro with `@a`, or with a number in front of it if you want to repeat the macro several times,
like `10@a`.

Here’s a short video to demonstrate how powerful macros can be. Their power is almost unlimited, especially since you
can even play macros inside recorded macros!

That’s all for this week. See you all next month, on the **5th Sep 2022** for a new full batch of Neovim updates.
