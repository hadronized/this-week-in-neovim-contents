- Following HEAD: breaking changes on master([#14090](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090))
  - [#19357](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19357): `input()` and `inputdialog()` no longer convert the value of
  `cancelreturn` to a string if it is passed in  an `opts` dictionary. It is still converted to a string if it is the
  third argument of `inputdialog()`.
