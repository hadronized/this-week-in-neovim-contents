# Neovim Core updates

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

- [#20020](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20020) introduced the following breaking changes:
    - `nvim_get_keymap` now always returns a LuaRef object as `callback` for a Lua mapping regardless of how it is
      called. The LuaRef object can be called from Lua and Vim script, but is lost over RPC.
    - `maparg()` now returns a Funcref instead of a ref number as `callback` for a Lua mapping. The Funcref can be
      called from Lua and Vim script, but is lost over RPC.

A neovim plugin for working with colors. It has different tools for modifying and/or creating new colors. There are
also some utilities for working with css colors.
Tools include a picker for rgb values, picking colors on a gradient, lighten/darken a color and make a color more grey.

[@mong8se] ported [DidYouMean](https://github.com/EinfachToll/DidYouMean), a Vim plugin, to Lua and thus Neovim.
Originally, the plugin is used when you open Neovim with a file that doesn’t exist. It then tries to suggest the real
file. A fun and useful plugin.

A plugin by [@Slyces] providing something similar to what the LSP _type hierarchy_ protocol could be… ahead of time.
This is similar to “implementations” of a given function interface, but for types. Probably very useful for OOP
languages. It’s easy to imagine that it would probably useful for interface dependencies as well (think of Haskell’s
classes, Rust traits, etc. etc.).

The plugin is still a WIP but it’s promising!

Struggle to keep your Neovim versions in check? [Bob](https://github.com/MordechaiHadad/bob) provides an easy way to
install and switch versions on any system! Bob is a cross-platform and easy-to-use Neovim version manager, allowing for
easy switching between versions right from the command line. Similar to tools like [rustup](https://rustup.rs/),
[ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), etc.

[@levouh] saw some interest in utilizing recently merged [support for per window highlight
namespaces](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/13457) and made `tint.nvim`. It makes inactive windows... well,
tinted compared to an active one. Note that this plugin requires relatively fresh development Neovim version.

[@superhawk610] wrote their first plugin! It quickly converts ASCII boxes into more visually appealing extended UTF-8
boxes (with a help from [utf8.lua](https://github.com/Stepets/utf8.lua)). Although it's way easier to just type `+` and
`|`, the extended UTF-8 box drawing characters look so much nicer! Great job!

This is an erratum from last week, because an important update was not included and it should have been. [@wincent]
rewrote [command-t](https://github.com/wincent/command-t) in Lua! The plugin provides an extremely fast "fuzzy"
mechanism for:

- Opening files and buffers.
- Jumping to tags and help.
- Running commands, or previous searches and commands.

Shout out to [@wincent] for taking the time to convert that Vim plugin to Lua and Neovim! 👏

[@phaazon] updated `Mind` to version `v2.2.0`, fixing bugs and adding a couple of new features. Here’s the changelog:

- Update requirements in the README (mainly `plenary.nvim`).
- Clean and fix documentation typos and instructions.
- Remove some deprecated warnings.
- Fix state JSON deserialization for prettified JSON.
- Fix change_icon_menu that didn’t correctly save the tree.
- Add `:MindClose`.
- Fix closing the tree with `:q`.
- Fix opening global project (i.e. a cwd-based project living in the main persistence place).
- Add smart project trees. Smart project trees are regular project trees, either global or local, but the interaction
  depends on their existence. If no project tree exists for the current cwd, the user is prompted which kind of tree
  they want (local / global). After that, `:MindOpenSmartProject` detects whether it must open a local or a global
  tree, with a priority on local trees.

All of that is available as part of `mind-v2.2.0`, so if you were using `branch = 'v2'`, you’re already covered.
Otherwise, you need to update to `branch = 'v2.2'` — no need to pin the patch version.

[@rebelot] made an update of `heirline.nvim` with a new tabline cookbook. You can take full control on buffer and tab
rendering (visible/active/inactive buffers, icons, file flags, git status, diagnostics, create the components you
like!), make buffer list to automatically paginate, and more.

You can now do `PackerUpdate --preview` ([#975](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/pull/975)) to first preview
possible changes, choose which plugins to actually update and then continue, instead of first updating and then checking
changes.

This together with two other recent changes:

- A compact setting to default to folding results to one line per plugin ([#1035](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/pull/1035)).
- Ability to show diff of a range of commits ([#1034](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/pull/1034)).

Gives a pretty neat update flow :):

Huge shoutout to [@akinsho] and [@wbthomason] for reviews, ideas and testing!!
