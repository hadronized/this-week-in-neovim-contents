A neovim plugin for working with colors. It has different tools for modifying and/or creating new colors. There are
also some utilities for working with css colors.
Tools include a picker for rgb values, picking colors on a gradient, lighten/darken a color and make a color more grey.

[@mong8se] ported [DidYouMean](https://github.com/EinfachToll/DidYouMean), a Vim plugin, to Lua and thus Neovim.
Originally, the plugin is used when you open Neovim with a file that doesn‚Äôt exist. It then tries to suggest the real
file. A fun and useful plugin.

A plugin by [@Slyces] providing something similar to what the LSP _type hierarchy_ protocol could be‚Ä¶ ahead of time.
This is similar to ‚Äúimplementations‚Äù of a given function interface, but for types. Probably very useful for OOP
languages. It‚Äôs easy to imagine that it would probably useful for interface dependencies as well (think of Haskell‚Äôs
classes, Rust traits, etc. etc.).

The plugin is still a WIP but it‚Äôs promising!

Struggle to keep your Neovim versions in check? [Bob](https://github.com/MordechaiHadad/bob) provides an easy way to
install and switch versions on any system! Bob is a cross-platform and easy-to-use Neovim version manager, allowing for
easy switching between versions right from the command line. Similar to tools like [rustup](https://rustup.rs/),
[ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), etc.

This is an erratum from last week, because an important update was not included and it should have been. [@wincent]
rewrote [command-t](https://github.com/wincent/command-t) in Lua! The plugin provides an extremely fast "fuzzy"
mechanism for:

- Opening files and buffers.
- Jumping to tags and help.
- Running commands, or previous searches and commands.

Shout out to [@wincent] for taking the time to convert that Vim plugin to Lua and Neovim! üëè

[op.nvim](https://github.com/mrjones2014/op.nvim), made by [@mrjones2014], just got support to edit passwords directly
in Neovim. Pretty cool!

[@phaazon] updated `Mind` to version `v2.2.0`, fixing bugs and adding a couple of new features. Here‚Äôs the changelog:

- Update requirements in the README (mainly `plenary.nvim`).
- Clean and fix documentation typos and instructions.
- Remove some deprecated warnings.
- Fix state JSON deserialization for prettified JSON.
- Fix change_icon_menu that didn‚Äôt correctly save the tree.
- Add `:MindClose`.
- Fix closing the tree with `:q`.
- Fix opening global project (i.e. a cwd-based project living in the main persistence place).
- Add smart project trees. Smart project trees are regular project trees, either global or local, but the interaction
  depends on their existence. If no project tree exists for the current cwd, the user is prompted which kind of tree
  they want (local / global). After that, `:MindOpenSmartProject` detects whether it must open a local or a global
  tree, with a priority on local trees.

You can now do `PackerUpdate --preview` ([#975](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/pull/975)) to first preview
possible changes, choose with plugins to actually update and then continue, instead of first updating and then checking
changes.

This together with two other recent changes:

* A compact setting to default to folding results to one line per plugin ([#1035](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/pull/1035)).
* Ability to show diff of a range of commits ([#1034](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/pull/1034)).

Gives a pretty neat update flow :):
