- [nvim-0.8 freeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/xft3jw/08_feature_freeze_and_preliminary_release_date/)
  (text extracted from the Reddit post by `u/bfredl`):

  As of today, Neovim nighty is entering the feature freeze period for the upcoming 0.8 release. No further features
  will be merged for 0.8, just bug fixes and documentation improvements (and possibly minor adjustments to new
  features/API).

  The preliminary release date for 0.8 is **30 September** (as has been our aim for some time), but might get delayed if
  needed for critical bug fixes to land. As an example, `cmdheight=0` feature recently received a larger change in
  implementation, is expected to need more testing and bug fixes before it is considered to be stable enough for a
  general release.

  The general advice of always updating Neovim nightly together with plugins applies. In particular, `nvim-treesitter`
  and other tree-sitter dependent plugins need to be updated for changes in Neovim core.

- [#20217](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20217) made Lua Funcrefs work as methods in Vim script. When using a
  Funcref converted from a Lua function as a method in Vim script, the result of the base expression is now passed as
  the first argument instead of being ignored.

This is an update gathering the release of two versions of the plugin: `v0.2` and `v0.3`.

From `v0.2`:

- Labels position is fixed and overlap with the matches like other _jump_ plugins (old behavior is still available via
  an option).
- You can now use `<Backspace>` to delete last characters of the pattern.t
- You can now use `<Alt-Backspace>` to restore the last version of the pattern that has matches.

From `v0.3`:

- An option was added to limit the maximum length of the pattern.
- An option was added to reuse the last pattern.
- A highlight was added to indicate when the next key must be for the label (when using `max_length_pattern`).

A huge update, then!

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

The `:%s` command substitutes text in your current buffer. For instance, `:%s/have/had/g` substitutes the word `have` by
`had` everywhere in your buffer. The `g` modifier makes it so that if you have `have` twice on the same line, both words
will be modified â€” omitting `g` will only replace the first occurrence on each line. You can also use `c` as an extra
modifier to be prompted with a replace confirmation for each occurrence.

Now, something that people might not know. Imagine you have the following buffer:

```rust
let _ = 32;
let _ = 32;
let _ = 32;

let x = foo(32);
let y = bar(32);
let z = zoo(32);
let a = quux(32);
let b = tronfibulate(32);

let _ = 32;
let _ = 32;
let _ = 32;
```

And you want to replace all of the `32` arguments to functions by `100`, but you donâ€™t want to replace couple of `32`
declarations at the top of the buffer and at the end. A way to do that would be to use `:%s/32/100/gc` and confirm only
when replacing `32` inside the functions arguments. But thatâ€™s not very practical. A better way is to use visual mode
commands! Select all the lines starting from `let x = â€¦` to `let b = â€¦` and press `:`. You can then enter the substitute
command to scope it to that selection; remember: `%` means the whole file; here, your command line will look like
something like `:'<,'>`, which are visual marks (donâ€™t change them!). So the substitute command will look like this:

```vim
:'<,'>s/32/100/g
```

And thatâ€™s all! You can see that the replacement was limited to the portion of text you selected. That works in visual,
line and block visual modes, so have fun replacing things!

`:h s_flags` for more information about the substitute flags.
