# Neovim Core updates

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

- [spellsitter merged to core!](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/x7k7r7/spellsitter_merged_to_neovim_core/). A
  huge contribution by [@lewis6991] and [@vigoux]. If you did not know, `spellsitter` is a tree-sitter powered spell
  checking mechanism that only checks spells for specified queries. This allows checking only relevant parts such as
  comments or markdown text for spelling errors. ([#19419](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19419))
- [#15391](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/15391) adds tree-sitter parsers and queries for core languages (C, Lua
  and VimL).

  Neovim now bundles parsers and highlight queries for Lua, Vimscript, and C; by default the former are installed in
  `/usr/local/lib/nvim/parsers`, the latter in `/usr/local/share/nvim/runtime/queries`. Parsers and queries from plugins and
  user configs should take precedence, but conflicts cannot be ruled out in some situations.

  To enable treesitter highlighting for Lua, add `vim.g.ts_highlight_lua = true` to your `init.lua`. (Note that this
  disables regex syntax highlighting, which plugins may rely on for functionality. In this case, add `vim.bo.syntax =
  'ON'` to `ftplugin/lua.lua` in your config.)

  **Note** that this does not work with `brew install neovim --HEAD`, which doesn't bundle parsers, see
  [discussions/3611](https://github.com/orgs/Homebrew/discussions/3611).

- [#20039](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20039) updates `nvim_parse_cmd()`.

  `nvim_parse_cmd()` now returns `tab = -1` instead of `tab = 0` when `:tab` modifier is absent. This makes it possible
  for `:[n]tab` to be properly forwarded to `nvim_cmd()` for all valid non-negative values.

- [#20105](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20105) changes tree-sitter runtime
  queries.

  The behavior of the runtime queries changed and now works as follows:

  - The *first* query in the `rtp` without and `extends` modeline will be used as the base query (typically implies the
    priority "user config > plugins > bundled runtime").
  - All queries (without a specific order) with an `extends` modeline are concatenated with the base query, see `:h
    lua-treesitter-query`.

  This has to be done to correctly handle different version of the queries, working with different parsers following
  [#15391](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/15391).

# Neovim Plugin Community updates

> Neovim is full of active plugins. This section is about the community and what is going on.

**Plugins supporting [SemVer](https://semver.org) will have a little badge on the right side of their title:
<span class="has-text-grey">SemVer</span> <span class="icon has-text-warning"><span class="fa-solid fa-star"></span></span>
Those plugins help contributing to a more stable Neovim ecosystem, and hence are put in front of others. Thank you!**

Hey, a new terminal plugin! [@Hvassaa] made their very first Neovim plugin, `sterm.nvim`, which stands for (s)tupid

> `inc-rename.nvim` is a small plugin that lets you preview Neovim `vim.lsp.buf.rename` command as you type (nightly
> only). It will highlight all occurrences of the variable in your buffers as you rename it.

![inc_rename.nvim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40792180/188309667-0d7e8086-ae48-4a25-8b01-df11d229b8c6.png)

`inc-rename.nvim` released a new update which adds proper support for the popular
[dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) plugin that enhances the appearance of Neovim's default
`vim.ui.input`. Now, the new name of a variable will be mirrored in `dressing`'s input buffer as you type in the command
line. There is still a small issue with the UI though that can only be fixed in Neovim itself (see
[#14735](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14735)).
