Fly through your tabs in neovim ✈️

I coded up this little telescope extension, allowing you to **quickly switch between your open tabs**. But the fun does not stop there. You can also **close tabs right from the picker** and **jump back to your last used tab** from wherever you want.

Note, that this only workes with "real" tabs (not buffers)!
