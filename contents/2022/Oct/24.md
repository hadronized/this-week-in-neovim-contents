# Neovim Core updates

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

- [#20428](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20428) removes `filetype.vim` in favor of the now default filetype.lua.

  (If you install from the repo, make sure to clean out `/usr/local/share/nvim/runtime before` make install.)
  The filetype detection logic and tests still align with Vim, so additions or changes still need to be contributed
  there first and then ported to Neovim.

# Neovim Plugin Community updates

> Neovim is full of active plugins. This section is about the community and what is going on.

A video introduction to [leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim) by [Code to The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjREVt2ZJU8ql-NC9Gu-TJw). The
video explains what is the plugin, its relationship to `lightspeed.nvim` and `sneak`, what you can do with it, etc. It
doesn’t go over the [EasyMotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) based plugins (such as
[Hop](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim)), so if you are looking for a comparison, that is not the right video.

Still a good watch if you are interested in sneak based motions.

The plugin received a couple of changes lately. The list is long, so you can see by yourself
[here](https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim/wiki/What's-New%3F) for the details. Here’s a TL;DR:

- An update view was added.
- Command formatters are now sexy like never!
- Confirm dialogs with button-like inputs.
- Telescope theming integration.
- `notify-send` support.
- Scrollbars and matched text for popups.

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

This week, I ([@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon)) wants to bring the attention of every plugin authors to an
important matter. I have seen numerous times plugins hosting the demo screenshots, gifs and videos of their contents
directly in the Git index. **Do not do that. I repeat, do not do that!** A typical Neovim plugin repository is basically
a bunch of Lua files, and even big projects should rarely exceed 1 MB of disk usage (text is light and the Git history
compressed). But a single (one!), high-resolution screenshot, can sit between 10 MB to 100 MB, completely ruining your
repository. People installing your plugin will have to download that screenshot for nothing.

You can drag and drop your image in **any GitHub project New Issue input** to get a permalink to host your media files.
Use it!
