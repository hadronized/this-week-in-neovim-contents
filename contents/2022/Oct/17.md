Pure lua replacement for [github/copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim). `Copilot.lua` has support for both Copilot Suggestion and
Copilot Panel, with custom keybindings and configurable settings. It also integrates nicely with other Lua plugins, e.g. `nvim-cmp`.

[@melkster] made their first plugin, [modicator.nvim](https://github.com/melkster/modicator.nvim), a cursorline number **mod**e ind**icator**. It's a simple plugin that changes the color of current line's line number based on your mode.
