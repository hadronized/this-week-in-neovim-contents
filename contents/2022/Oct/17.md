Pure lua replacement for [github/copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim). `Copilot.lua` has support for both Copilot Suggestion and
Copilot Panel, with custom keybindings and configurable settings. It also integrates nicely with other Lua plugins, e.g. `nvim-cmp`.

> ðŸ§  Smart, directional Neovim and tmux split resizing and navigation. Think about splits in terms of "up/down/left/right". 

![smart-splits.nvim demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8648891/195688897-993d1ef1-c81e-44d0-98e1-57b00e588b56.gif)

`smart-splits.nvim` now has a `tmux` integration for seamless navigation between Neovim splits and `tmux` panes! Use the same intuitive, directional, cyclic navigation keymaps to jump between Neovim splits and tmux panes. See [README.md](https://github.com/mrjones2014/smart-splits.nvim#tmux-integration) for configuration.
