Pure lua replacement for [github/copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim). `Copilot.lua` has support for both Copilot Suggestion and
Copilot Panel, with custom keybindings and configurable settings. It also integrates nicely with other Lua plugins, e.g. `nvim-cmp`.

`jc.nvim` â€“ successor of [vim-javacomplete2](https://github.com/artur-shaik/vim-javacomplete2)
which uses Neovim's built-in LSP client and [Eclipse JDT Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls).

Main goal of this project is to migrate all the functionallties of jc2 to Neovim.

In addition to autocompletion, it can:

- organize imports;
- generate code (`toString`, `hashCode`, `equals`, constructors, accessors) with field selection;
- add abstract methods to implementing class;
- execute [vimspector](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector) debug session;
- automatic installation of jdt.ls and java-debug extension;
- class creation methods from `jc2`.

It's written by [@artur-shaik](https://github.com/artur-shaik) and you can read his [blog post](https://shaik.link/posts/javacomplete-to-jc.nvim/) about it.
