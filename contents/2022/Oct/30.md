This **TWiN #16** is a special weekly update, so I need to make a small announcement in your feed to ensure people read
this right away. I ([@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon)) took the time this week to update the Rust library I use to
parse the weekly updates (called `twin`). Next week, for **TWiN #17**, the contribution process changes a bit, following
the changes I introduced in `twin-0.2`. If you have already contributed to TWiN or plan to, then you will probably want
to read [the following updated section on the
README](https://github.com/phaazon/this-week-in-neovim-contents#structure-and-architecture). If not, jump directly to
[the next section](#neovim-core-updates)!

# [Neovim Core updates](#neovim-core-updates) {#neovim-core-updates}

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

</h3>

The plugin has been around for a couple of weeks now, and it’s time to provide some feedback on it! A poll was opened on
Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/yczda4/need_some_feedback_on_noice/) to ask people whether they
would like a single plugin or several ones to split the features. The first two options,
_“I'm fine with all functionality in one plugin”_ and _“I prefer multiple plugins”_ are pretty even! The poll is over
but feedback is always appreciated.

The background discussion is interesting, because it’s about whether we want an ecosystem thriving of new, small
plugins, or whether we want bigger, more monolithic plugins.

This living blog post introduces piece by piece a sample Neovim configuration to
kickstart your configuration targeting Rust development. The blog was recently
updated to remove all VimL and uses Lua as its main configuration language.

The reader will learn how to setup
[packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) and install plugins such as [rust-tools.nvim](https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim)
to take full advantage of the built-in LSP of neovim.

[@MrcJkb](https://github.com/MrcJkb) made a plugin for Haskellers wanting to leverage the power of both Haskell and
Neovim! Besides support for the famous [HLS](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server), the plugin configures
the LSP client with sane and good defaults, like automatically refreshing lenses, adding the right capabilities
depending on your installed plugins, etc.

The plugin also supports [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) so that you can search what’s under your cursor, and a
list of planned features is available
[here](https://github.com/MrcJkb/haskell-tools.nvim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).

![leap-spooky.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap-spooky.nvim/blob/media/showcase.gif?raw=true)

Spooky is a [Leap](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim) extension that allows for remote operations on Vim's native text objects. It exposes atomic bundles of (virtual or actual) leaping motions and text object selections, so that you can e.g. yank a paragraph without leaving your position (`yarp<leap>`), or fix a typo in a very short, atomic command sequence, even from another window (`ciRw<leap>`). The origin of this idea can be traced to the "leaping motions" feature of [vim-seek](https://github.com/goldfeld/vim-seek). (The name clash is a funny coincidence. We should probably have named our feature "seeking motions" in exchange...)

The plugin is highly experimental at the moment - it would be great to gather as much feedback as possible. ([@ggandor](https://github.com/ggandor))

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

Are you tired of having your cursor jump all around the place when you cross the path of a line that is shorter than the
line you are currently on? Some people can be upset with that, so there is a drastic solution: `:set virtualedit=all`.
This will cause Neovim to authorize you to edit _anywhere_ in the view (not only the buffer). What it means is that you
can put your cursor in an empty zone, press your insert key and add text. It will automatically fill the left part of
the line with empty space.

A less drastic option of `virtualedit` is the `onemore` variant (`:set virtualedit=onemore`), which allows you to edit
past the end of the line by one character. Pressing `$` will put your cursor on the last character, and pressing `l` (or
whatever key is bound for you) will move the cursor by end extra character.
