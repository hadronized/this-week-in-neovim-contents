As author of [This Week in Neovim](/), I ([@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon)) was pleased to read
[such a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/zb60ms/neovim_plugins_appreciation_post/) on Reddit. The
community is growing fast and we can all congragulate ourselves for the new plugins and existing ecosystem that is
thriving.

Give it up for the plugin authors — and yourself if you are one! — and don’t hesitate to drop a comment in the
aforementioned Reddit post thread! I also use the opportunity of that post to mention that plugin authors are **highly
encouraged** to open pull-requests to the [content repository of This Week in Neovim](https://github.com/phaazon/this-week-in-neovim-contents#how-to-contribute)
in order to help me continue providing weekly updates!
