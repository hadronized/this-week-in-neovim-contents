Kreative is a minimalistic approach to generating colorschemes for end users. You only need to provide 8 colors,
alongside some boilerplate code, inside a regular colorscheme file in /colors to generate a colorscheme for you.
Kreative does all the work generating shades based on them. It even comes with 16 color support alongside terminal
output for 4 popular terminals! Meaning you can take your colorscheme just about anywhere in the terminal world.
