> `snippet-converter.nvim` is a plugin that allows you to parse, transform and convert snippets supporting a variety of
> different formats.

The new version **1.4.0** now supports snippets created for the Emacs snippet engine YASnippet! If you're an Emacs user
and want to keep using snippet collections such as
[yasnippet-snippets](https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets), that is now possible by simple converting
them to a format supported by your Neovim snippet engine of choice (e.g. `vscode_luasnip` for LuaSnip).
