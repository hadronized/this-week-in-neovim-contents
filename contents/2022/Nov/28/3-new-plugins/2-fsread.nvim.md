This is a new special plugin that allows to minimize the amount of data to read to understand the content. I was not
convinced at firstâ€¦ and after a couple of minutes, I was stunned to realize that actually works quite well! This is
probably more interesting if you are reading prose rather than code.

A really nice addition by [@nullchilly](https://github.com/nullchilly).
