This is a plugin for those looking for a VSCode-like experience in Neovim.

Some of the unique features:

- A rich set of default plugins which make up an IDE experience:
- A panel which stacks plugins similar to VSCode:
- The ability to swap groups of plugins into panels, similar to VSCode:
- A well defined API for creating out-of-tree plugins and extending `nvim-ide`.
