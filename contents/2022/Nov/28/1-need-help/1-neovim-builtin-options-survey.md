> Survey to find out how people use Neovim built-in options

Have you ever wondered, which leader key people use the most? Is it default `\`, `<Space>`, `,`, or something else? And
how about answering the eternal question "Tabs or spaces?"? This survey aims to gather data which will help answer this
type of questions. And it needs your help!

It should take at most 5 minutes of your time. Basically: download Lua script
([with this source code](https://gist.github.com/echasnovski/493329c67050e9dcc5546815f31179d0)), source it inside your
regular Neovim instance, copy output, paste in Google Form question, and submit. More information is inside post and
submission form.
