> Survey to find out how people use Neovim built-in options

Have you ever wondered, which `Leader` key people use the most? Is it default `\`, `<Space>`, `,`, or something else? And how about answering the eternal question "Tabs or spaces?"? This survey aims to gather data which will help answer this type of questions. And it needs your help!

It should take at most 5 minutes of your time. Basically: download Lua script ([with this source code](https://gist.github.com/echasnovski/493329c67050e9dcc5546815f31179d0)), source it inside your regular Neovim instance, copy output, paste in Google Form question, and submit. More information is inside post and submission form.
