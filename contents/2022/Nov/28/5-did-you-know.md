You probably know the `*` key, which allows you to search the word under your cursor. Pressing `n` will go to the next
occurrence, and pressing `N` will go backwards. If you press `*` on a word that is the last occurrenc in your buffer, it
will go back up to the top of your buffer to continue searching, probably moving your view by quite a lot of lines.
