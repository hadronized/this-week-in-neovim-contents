A motionless motion plugin! Yep, that’s a thing. Take a motion plugin, like
[leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim) or [hop.nvim](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim), and make it
possible to yank, paste, and perform various actions using the typical hints, but without moving your cursor. Plugins
can provide that, but `easy-action` does it for various plugins with a different way (plugins like Leap and Hop might
already support it, or will, but it’s nice to see something doing it using plugins’ API).
