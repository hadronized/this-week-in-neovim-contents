Portal is a plugin that aims to build upon and enhance existing jumplist motions (i.e. <kbd>c-o</kbd> and
<kbd>c-i</kbd>) by surfacing contextual information with the use of
[portals](https://github.com/cbochs/portal.nvim#portals), and providing multiple jump options by
means of [queries](https://github.com/cbochs/portal.nvim#queries). That is a very interesting new kind of moving around;
definitly worth a try!
