This plugin wasnâ€™t introduced before it was released.
A tiny (currently 337 LoC) collection of custom UI utilities, written by [@hood](https://github.com/hood), to make your
NeoVim workflow faster. It consists of two (ui-overrider, input-overrider) utilities which override Neovim's default
`vim.ui.select` and `vim.ui.input`, spawning a floating menu right where your cursor resides, and a
diagnostics-navigator utility to quickly navigate (and jump to) LSP diagnostics issues in the current buffer.

The plugin is also dependency free, now!

Alternatives are [dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) and
