Even though that plugin was written a few months back, we never introduced it in TWiN, so here we go!
A plugin written by [@samjwill](https://github.com/samjwill) that leverages Neovim's built-in RPC
functionality to simplify opening files from within Neovim's terminal emulator without
unintentionally nesting sessions.

The plugin now supports Git commits, multiple sessions, and free from reliance on external tools!
