This cool plugin allows you to interact with Gists from Github (Gitlab snippets support will probably be coming too!).
Right now it allows you to create a Gist from the current buffer or from a file, and also to list all your Gists and edit their files on the fly in a neovim buffer (I find it dope not only because that's my contribution to the plugin ðŸ˜‰, I'm not the author).
Many features may be coming soon, obviously you should go ahead and try them!
