</h3>

As an avid user of Neovim and a passionate supporter of the project, I often find myself compelled to contribute to plugins when they don't work as expected. Although I am not a plugin developer and don't personally know Phaazon, my enthusiasm for Neovim drives me to get involved. Like many of you, I believe in the power of open source collaboration: forking, making changes, committing, and submitting pull requests.

A few days ago, I came across an sad/interesting ![Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/13b8oo9/help_needed_twins_future/) and also checked out ![Phaazon's blog post](https://phaazon.net/blog/editors-in-2022). Inspired by these discoveries, I decided to add an additional task to my workflow: contributing to TWiN.

After contributing to another project, I realized that suggesting to its owner in a comment on the PR to contribute to TWiN would be an easy and impactful step. I reached out to him, and it turned out that he was facing some difficulties. Consequently, I took the initiative and made the pull request myself.

Today, I managed to accomplish all of this without investing too much time. I encourage each and every one of you to consider doing the same in the future. By helping maintain projects and contributing to the awesome Neovim ecosystem, we can ensure its smooth functioning and reduce headaches for everyone involved. Let's work together in peace.
