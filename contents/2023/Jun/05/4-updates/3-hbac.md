> Automagically close the unedited buffers in your bufferlist when it becomes too long.

In the new release we introduce a telescope picker which is similar to telescope buffer picker but with additional hbac features such as displaying pin state, toggling pin state and deleting buffers.

Also we adjusted the order in which buffers get auto-closed so that if you have any unnamed buffers those will be closed first.
