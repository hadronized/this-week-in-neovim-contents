Portal.nvim has received a full plugin rewrite! This rewrite brings a host of new features, simplified user API, and 
plenty of code cleanup. A few notable changes:

- **Simplified** user command and lua API
- **Builtin** support for the `jumplist`, `changelist`, and `qflist` location lists
- **Ability** to [filter](https://github.com/cbochs/portal.nvim#filters) search results
- **Ability** to [query](https://github.com/cbochs/portal.nvim#portal-api) multiple location lists in a single search
