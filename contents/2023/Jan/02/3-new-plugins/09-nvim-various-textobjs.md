A new plugin that bundles more than a dozen textobjects (dozens!), written by 
[@chrisgrieser](https://github.com/chrisgrieser). Among its features:

- Supports forward seeking of text objects (if appropriate for the type of textobj).
- Minimal configuration if you are fine with the default keybindings.
- Supports visual and operator pending mode.
- Fully written in Lua.
- Readme includes an example for further processing the textobjects, like opening the next js-regex pattern in 
  regex101.com (prefilled with pattern, flags, and replacement).

Nice addition!
