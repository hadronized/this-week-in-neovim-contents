Declarative **cas**cade **key** mapping configuration. The plugin written by [@Nexmean](https://github.com/Nexmean) can:

- Define all your keymaps as simple lua tables.
- Group keymaps the way you think about them.
- Modular, declarative way to define keymaps.
- It's as easy to define buffer local keymaps as global.
- [which-key.nvim](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) integration out of the box.

Congrats on the plugin!
