AÂ new plugin by [@andrewferrier](https://github.com/andrewferrier) which is designed to make it easier to handle soft
and hard line wrapped files, and is especially useful if you deal with a lot of text-like files in Neovim (Markdown,
AsciiDoc, text, etc.) from different sources with different types of line wrapping. It's based on an older vim plugin
the author wrote called `vim-wrapping-softhard`.
