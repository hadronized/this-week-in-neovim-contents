The author would like to remind that following the announcement of
[Neovim 0.9 to be released in Feb 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/zy9iox/neovim_v082_released/), the
plugin is going to have a migration / refactoring that might imply configuration issues. The author opens a discussion
to discuss possible migration paths and warnings before the actual breaking changes start appearing.
