New support for Lazy.nvim

The wrapper is now more intelligent with setting up your plugin manager by
waiting until your config calls for it. As such it is no longer limited to only
Packer based configs and has added Lazy support.  
If you want to use it with another plugin manager feel free to open an issue or
pr.
