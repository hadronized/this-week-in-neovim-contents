New support for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

The wrapper is now more intelligent with setting up your plugin manager by waiting until your config calls for it. As
such it is no longer limited to only Packer based configs and has added Lazy support. If you want to use it with
another plugin manager feel free to open an issue or PR.
