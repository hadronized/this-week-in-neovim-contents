A terminal manager plugin that treats terminals as buffers, not windows. Providing smooth window navigation like Vim8 and freedom for window management.

- Enter terminal buffer in any window you like.
- `<C-w>` keymap for window navigation even in terminal mode.
- Save terminal mode by each terminal buffer and restore it when re-entering.
- Easily switch between listed terminal buffers.
- High compatibility with native commands like `:terminal`, `:wincmd`, and `:buffer`.
