Minimally invasive session manager powered by `fzf-lua`: `nvim-possession` does _only_ what you need and no more, making 
managing sessions quick and visually appealing! Browse, create and delete sessions dynamically, add your statusline 
component and you are ready to go!

Sessions can also be loaded and saved automagically, and you can provide post-hooks callbacks to make sure your terminal 
windows and file managers and properly restored too!
