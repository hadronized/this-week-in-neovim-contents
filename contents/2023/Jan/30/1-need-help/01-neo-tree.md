The project could really use some awesome developers that have some free time and love that they can dedicate to 
maintaining the project. Up until recently, the author has been the primary person to triage issues, fix bugs, plan new 
features, etc. The plugin received lots of great contributions from the community, which is very much appreciated by
the author, but the project needs to continue growing and calls for someone to step up and take a lead role on the 
project. More than one person would even be better!

From the author:

> I don't have the same amount of free time that I had when I started the project, and I am no longer really keeping up 
> the way I should. I'm not looking to completely drop out of the project, but I would like to take a backseat if 
> there's anyone out there interested in being a maintainer.
