> Melange is a warm colorscheme for Neovim and terminal emulators.

The repository for Melange was renamed from `savq/melange` to `savq/melange-nvim`.
If you happen to use Melange, you should update how it's listed in your configuration.
GitHub still redirects the old URL, but better safe than sorry.

Melange itself had a big update this week that replaces the lush.nvim
implementation with direct calls to the Neovim API (it no longer supports Vim 9).
The color palette was adjusted, and the list of highlight groups was also updated.
