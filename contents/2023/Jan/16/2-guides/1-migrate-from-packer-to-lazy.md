`r/nvim` member and YouTuber [/u/elijah_manor](https://www.reddit.com/user/elijah_manor/) has made an informative and 
user friendly guide for [migrating from Packer.nvim to Lazy.nvim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqlxqpHs-aQ). Great 
for those of us who've been meaning to lazy load their plugins but were tooâ€¦ lazy to figure out how. The conversion is 
very simple, so if you don't want to commit to leaving Packer, it's a short process and very easy to convert back and 
forth to try it out. Thanks Elijah!
