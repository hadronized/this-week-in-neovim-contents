[@roobert](https://github.com/roobert) created a shell script to ease even further the contribution process to TWiN! The
script will do various things for you, mostly boilerplate, such as cloning the contents repository, ask for whether you
are adding a guide, new plugin, update of an existing plugin, etc. and will create the formatted skeleton for the entry.
Very good job and really appreciated!
