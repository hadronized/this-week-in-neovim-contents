This new module of `mini.nvim` makes it easier to move any selection in any direction. Basically, you select text 
(charwise with `v`, linewise with `V`, blockwise with `CTRL-V`, or use current line in Normal mode) and press 
customizable mapping to move it in all four directions (left, right, down, up) while remembering your selection. Handles
both `v:count` and undo history.
