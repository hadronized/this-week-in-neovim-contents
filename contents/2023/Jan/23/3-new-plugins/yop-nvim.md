Make your own operators easily!

A new plugin that makes aims to make it as easy as possible to make your own
custom neovim operators (like, `d`, `c`, `gq`, and `y`). Just define a
handler function and put it in a keymap!

Checkout some [examples](https://github.com/zdcthomas/yop.nvim/wiki/Example-mappings)!
