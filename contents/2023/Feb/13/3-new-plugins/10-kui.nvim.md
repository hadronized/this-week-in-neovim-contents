A _very_ (**very**) experimental and pre-beta plugin, but according to the author, 
[@romgrk](https://github.com/romgrk), itâ€™s running well and probably useful enough for simple popups or widgets. 
If it gives any of you ideas/inspiration, at this point, the author is looking for feedback into how this could be used
and how to package it better. It's a typescript project. More on that in the Reddit thread.
