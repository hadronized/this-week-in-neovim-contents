Actually a Zsh plugin, which runs a command starting with `:` as an Ex-command and echoes the result.

The Ex-command runs on an existing Neovim session, which is by default a parent Neovim session when Zsh is in the Neovim's 
terminal. The Neovim session can be elsewhere, such as one on a different Tmux' pane from a Zsh session.
