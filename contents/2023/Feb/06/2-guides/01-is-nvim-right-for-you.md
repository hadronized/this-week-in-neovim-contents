Nikfp wrote a blog post a few weeks ago outlining what to expect for the Neovim-curious and anyone who's frustrated with 
their current editor. The article touches on what Vim / Neovim is and goes in depth about Nik's experience making the 
switch. Also included are some resources for people as they dive in and join the fun. It's a lenghty article, but it 
should prove helpful to anyone getting started or considering making a change.
