[Last week](https://this-week-in-neovim.org/2023/Feb/20#update-feline.nvim), the author of `feline.nvim` announced that
the plugin was discontinued and no longer maintained. This week brings a happier news: its development was moved to
[@freddiehaddad](https://github.com/freddiehaddad)! The important thing regarding the original author, 
[@Famiu](https://github.com/famiu), is that they wanted the project to be forked instead of transferring the full 
ownership of the project.

You are then advised to make the migration to the new GitHub repository.
