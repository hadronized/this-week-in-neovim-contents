Do you dislike writing Neovim plugins in Lua? Imagine writing your plugins in a strictly typed language. It has been
possible to write Neovim plugins in different languages, transpiling them to Lua (example with 
[Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/) for `emacs` aficionados). This new plugin written by 
[@danielo515](https://github.com/danielo515) is more of a [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) library than a real Neovim plugin.
It allows you to write your plugins in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), which is pretty cool!

Good job!
