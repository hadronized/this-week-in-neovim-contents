The plugin author made a public announcement regarding the maintainance status of the plugin. `feline.nvim` is no
longer maintained and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/feline-nvim/feline.nvim) has been archived. This is a
sad news and we wish the author, [@Famiu](https://github.com/famiu), a good amount of rest and not to let go of making
their projects open-source and public. FOSS **is hard**, more often than we think, and this kind of dilemma happens all
the time. Don’t formalize too much and get well!

If you were using `feline.nvim` as a statusline, several alternatives exist:

- You can make yours on your own if you don’t want to be too fancy. See the [Did you know?](#tips) section for more.
- [rockerBOO/awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) has sections about this very topic:
