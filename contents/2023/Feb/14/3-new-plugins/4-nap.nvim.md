Lightweight plugin inspired by [unimpaired.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired) to 
jump between next and previous buffer, tab, file, quickfix, diagnostic with a single key.

It is extensible to work with other plugins, for example, jump between next/previous diff through
[Gitsigns](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim), or next/previous symbols with
[Aerial](https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim), etc.
