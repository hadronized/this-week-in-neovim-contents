</h3>

> `mason.nvim` is a portable package manager for Neovim that runs everywhere Neovim runs. Easily install and manage LSP 
> servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters.

The core package registry for `mason.nvim` is being migrated to 
[https://github.com/mason-org/mason-registry](https://github.com/mason-org/mason-registry). This will be an entirely 
seamless migration, with no action required by users.
