AstroNvim v3 has also brought the release of the 
[AstroNvim Community Repository](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity) which aims to be a community lead plugin 
marketplace for users to build and share neovim plugin configurations specifically designed for AstroNvim. This can 
range from adding single plugins and colorschemes to setting up entire language support packs!
